## How It Works

1. **Layout & Styling**  
   - Uses a `radial-gradient` background for a premium dark-gold aesthetic.  
   - `div.card` elements display products with background images, prices, and short descriptions.  

2. **Interactivity**  
   - On card click → jQuery toggles the `.show-description` class.  
   - Expands the product description (`p`) from **60px → 180px**.  
   - Reveals hidden `<small>` text with opacity transition.  

3. **Responsiveness**  
   - `@media (max-width: 600px)` ensures optimal scaling for mobile.  
   - Cards shrink, typography adjusts, and navigation spacing reduces.
